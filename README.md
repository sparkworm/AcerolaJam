You are their creation.
But they have bred an aberration.

You are purple.
All others are gold.
But their blood is red.
They bear you ill will.
They want you dead.

You can become red like their insides.

Bathe in their blood.

======================

Your goal is to escape the laboratory.
When you touch the enemy's blood, you become just a little more red.

======================

This is my submission for the Acerola Game Jam.
The Acerola Game Jam took place 28, February, 2024 to 14, March, 2024.
This Jam had the theme of "aberration", hence the odd "poem" at the beginning.

The blood features were never fully implemented due to the timeframe.

This project is made in Godot version 4.2.1 stable
